# EigenAstroSim

EigenAstroSim is a desktop application that simulates astronomical equipment for astrophotography software development and testing. It provides ASCOM-compliant virtual devices (mount, camera, and rotator) that can be used by other astrophotography software for development and troubleshooting.

## Simulation Engine

At the heart of EigenAstroSim is a powerful simulation engine that serves as the central coordinator for all virtual astronomical equipment. This engine provides a realistic, physics-based simulation of astrophotography conditions and equipment behavior.

### Core Concepts

The simulation engine:

- **Models real-world astronomy equipment** (mounts, cameras, rotators) with high fidelity
- **Simulates environmental conditions** such as atmospheric seeing, clouds, and transparency
- **Generates realistic imagery** including star fields, sensor noise, and optical effects
- **Coordinates time-dependent behaviors** across all components

### Component-Based Architecture

The engine uses a component-based architecture that mirrors the physical separation of astronomical equipment:

- **Mount component**: Handles telescope pointing, tracking, guiding, and modeling mechanical errors
- **Camera component**: Manages exposure timing, image generation, and sensor characteristics
- **Rotator component**: Controls image rotation and field orientation
- **Atmosphere component**: Simulates environmental conditions affecting image quality

This modular design allows each component to evolve independently while maintaining cohesive overall behavior.

### Message-Driven Communication

The simulation engine uses a message-based communication system:

1. **Equipment commands** are sent as messages to the appropriate components
2. **Components process commands** and update their internal state accordingly
3. **State changes generate events** that can be observed by UI and other components
4. **Image generation** occurs based on the combined state of all components

This approach enables asynchronous operation and clean separation between components, mimicking the way real astronomical equipment operates.

### Observable State Changes

All state changes in the simulation are exposed as observable streams, allowing:

- **Real-time UI updates** as equipment state changes
- **Reactive behavior chains** where one component responds to another's state
- **Temporal simulation** with precise timing control

### Extensibility

The simulation engine is designed for extensibility, allowing:

- **Addition of new equipment types** (like filter wheels, focusers, etc.)
- **Enhanced simulation models** with greater physical accuracy
- **Custom equipment behaviors** for testing edge cases
- **Integration with external systems** via the ASCOM interfaces

This extensible design ensures that EigenAstroSim can grow to accommodate new types of astronomical equipment and more sophisticated simulation needs.

## Development Approach

The project follows:

- **Functional Programming**: Using immutable data structures and function composition
- **Test-Driven Development**: With comprehensive unit and property-based tests
- **Reactive Programming**: Using Rx.NET for event-based and asynchronous operations
- **Message-Based Architecture**: Using message passing for state updates
- **MVVM Pattern**: For separation of concerns in the UI
