## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing a high-fidelity Virtual Astrophotography Sensor alongside our existing image generation system. The implementation will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach, combining both unit testing and property-based testing to ensure correctness and robustness.

We'll maintain backward compatibility with our current system while progressively building the sophisticated physics-based model. The transition will be incremental, with well-defined milestones and integration points.

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Incremental Development**: Build the system layer-by-layer
3. **Dual Implementation**: Maintain both implementations during transition
4. **Behavior-Based Testing**: Focus tests on observable behaviors rather than implementation details

## Current System Analysis

Our current implementation has these core components:

1. **Domain Models**:
   - `Star`, `StarField`, `Mount`, `Camera`, `Rotator`, `Atmosphere` types
   - Simple properties focused on basic positioning and characteristics

2. **StarFieldGenerator**:
   - Creates star distributions based on galactic latitude
   - Models magnitude and color distributions

3. **ImageGeneration**:
   - Single-pass image generation
   - Basic atmospheric seeing model
   - Simple sensor noise and effects
   - Satellite trail generation

4. **SimulationEngine**:
   - Actor-based message processing 
   - Reactive state updates
   - Coordinated component simulation

## Target Architecture

The new Virtual Astrophotography Sensor will introduce:

1. **Subframe Architecture**:
   - 0.1s temporal slices
   - Progressive photon accumulation
   - Evolution of conditions during exposure

2. **Transformation Pipeline**:
   - Celestial object representation
   - Optical system transformation
   - Multi-layer atmospheric turbulence
   - Mount tracking and errors
   - Sensor physics and electronics
   - Signal processing

3. **Advanced Physics Models**:

   - Kolmogorov turbulence
   - Quantum efficiency and photon statistics
   - Accurate noise characteristics

## Test-Driven Development Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach

Each component will be developed following this TDD cycle:

1. **Write Failing Test**: Create a test that defines expected behavior
2. **Implement Minimally**: Write just enough code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the implementation while keeping tests passing
4. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add edge cases and integration tests

### Property-Based Testing Approach

For complex behaviors with many possible inputs, we'll leverage property-based testing:

1. **Define Properties**: Identify invariants that should always hold
2. **Generate Test Cases**: Use generators to produce a wide range of inputs
3. **Verify Properties**: Test that properties hold across generated inputs
4. **Shrink Counter-Examples**: When failures occur, find minimal failing case
